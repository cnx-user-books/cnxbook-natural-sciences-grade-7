          <title>Movement</title>
          <para id="id24867573">The earthworm moves by means of muscles in the segments that contract and relax, causing the body to become long and thin, and then short and thick. The hairs on the segments press against the soil and the worm then moves forward.</para>

          <title>Feeding</title>
          <para id="id23626743">The earthworm comes out of the ground at night and pulls rotting plant material into its tunnel with the help of the lip in front of its mouth. It also eats the soil as it tunnels through the ground.</para>

          <para id="id25527174">The earthworm breathes through its moist skin. It therefore is important that the skin remains moist, as the worm is dependent on a moist environment.</para>

          <title>Maintaining a water balance</title>
